//Follow mockup and make it into a fully functioning website.

Peer-Reviewed by Richard Johnson:

The site is fairly accurate to the prototype site for the Hamster hotel. The website's overall layout matches pretty closely, and the cards were spaced similarly to the ones in the prototype, which I hadn't been able to do in my version of the site. Several other elements of the site are also spaced correctly in ways that are more accurate than my site.

 However, there are a few areas that could be improved. In the nav bar, only the "reserve" button has a white border appear when the mouse hovers over it, and the border is only visible for a split second. It also pushes the other links on the nav bar to the side when it appears. One of the headings is also missing, specifically the one for "Our Rooms." Some of the images are also a little squished from being resized, and there is also some text which is white instead of the intended light blue. It also doesn't seem that there was any time to add any responsiveness to the site.

 Though, overall, this is still a good attempt to recreate the prototype site.
